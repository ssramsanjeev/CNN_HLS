Implementation Overview
1. Input Image (cnn_input.ppm)

A 256×256 grayscale lung X-ray image (converted from PPM).

The image is read pixel-by-pixel into an FPGA-compatible ap_uint<8> array.

2. Hardware Accelerator (real_top)

The top-level HLS module that divides the input image into four 64×64 tiles.

Each tile passes through a multi-layer convolutional pipeline (convol) consisting of:

Sobel filters (X & Y): Edge detection

ReLU activation: Removes negatives

Max pooling: Reduces spatial dimensions

Laplacian, Gaussian, DoG, and Sharpen filters: Feature enhancement and texture extraction

After several stages of convolution + pooling, the final output feature map has reduced spatial size (16×16).

3. Merging and Output

The four processed tiles are merged back into a single output array.

The final processed output is written back as cnn_output.ppm for visual verification.

4. Feature Extraction

The 16×16 feature map (256 features) is flattened using Python and stored as cnn_features.txt.

These values represent spatially compressed but feature-rich data, ready for ML input.
