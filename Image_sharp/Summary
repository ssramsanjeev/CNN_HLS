Image Sharpening – Early Stage of the CNN Accelerator

The project began with implementing a simple image sharpening operation using a convolution kernel, without any pooling or activation layers.
At this stage, the goal was to understand and accelerate basic convolution in hardware before moving toward a full CNN pipeline.

Process:

A single 3×3 sharpening kernel was applied to the input grayscale image.
Example kernel: [ 0  1  0]
                [-1  5 -1]
                [ 0 -1  0]

The convolution operation enhances edges and contrast — producing a “sharper” image.

No ReLU or Pooling layers were used at this stage — the objective was purely to validate convolution logic, memory access patterns, and pixel throughput in HLS.

Results:

The “before” image shows the original input.

The “after” image demonstrates the effect of the sharpening kernel.

This step served as the foundation for later stages — where multiple convolution layers, pooling, and ReLU would form the full CNN accelerator.
